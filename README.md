asus_smartgesture_reload_fix
-

This little batch script is meant to help "fixing" the **ASUS SmartGesture** disabling problem. For some reason
when most ASUS laptops with Windows 8.1 get in sleep state ASUS SmartGesture process never returns back if
you don't restart the system or in some cases (like mine) it never starts again, so trying to solve my problem
I found that it only takes to restar the processes of the SmartGesture application and everithing works well again.
But if you are using the touch pad for a long period it starts to do it's work a little more slowly, in some buggy way...
I don't know if the application gets overloaded or if it has some cache that makes it collapse over time but seems that
restarting the process works. So I decided to make a simple batch script to simplify my work by One Click and now
as I see a lot of peaople have the same problem I will share with you my so called "fix" :]
If you want to add something or test it feel free to do so.

This batch script was tested on Windows 8.1 and I can't give you any warranty that will solve your problem with
any other versions of Windows, but it's supposed to work well with all laptops using ASUS SmartGesture with
Windows 8.0, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10
